# Open Childcare API

Open Childcare API is the childcare industry standard for communication between childcare apps and childcare platforms via REST messaging. 
  
The Open API Initiative ([https://www.openapis.org](https://www.openapis.org)) is an open standards body focusing on developing agreed representations of REST messaging layout that are programming language- and technology-independent. Its Open API Specification 
([https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)) is the agreed industry description format for messages that are to be exchanged over a REST. The Open Childcare API uses the Open API Specification.   
  
Tools such as Swagger Codegen ([https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)) can be used to generate client and server stubs for communicating over the Open Childcare API. 
  
**Note for Angular 6 and Ionic 4 developers:** The Open Childcare Framework ([https://github.com/LaunchingRockets/open-childcare-framework](https://github.com/LaunchingRockets/open-childcare-framework))provides a client implementation of the Open Chidlcare API along with UI components that may be useful when writting interactive apps to communicate with platforms that implement this API. 
  
One commercial platform that provides a server implementation of the Open Childcare API is Launching Rockets INSERT WEBSITE URL HERE.
